> # What is module in js ?
 >A module is just a file. One script is one module
  >A module is just a piece of code in a file that you can call and use from other files. A modular design is the opposite of having all your project's code in one single file.

When developing a big project, it's very useful to divide our code into modules for the following reasons:

1. It's good for dividing concerns and features into different files, which helps visualization and organization of code.
2. Code tends to be easier to maintain and less prone to errors and bugs when it's clearly organized.
3. Modules can be easily used and reused in different files and parts of our project, without needing to rewrite the same code again.

>Instead of having all of our program's components in a single file, we can divide it into parts or modules, and make each of them responsible for a single feature/concern.
